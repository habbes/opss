The objective of this review is to assist the secretariat in:

<li>Providing preliminary comments and suggestions for improving the research proposal as well as to suggest (send) literature for the same purpose.</li>
<li>Advising the author(s) to withdraw the preliminary research proposals if it is not relevant to the designated research themes, if it is of poor quality and or if it overlaps with previously/currently supported research.</li>
<li>Recommending acceptance of the preliminary research proposal as is for inclusion in future workshop agenda.</li>

We would like to receive the review within <b>three weeks</b> so that we can write to the researchers without much delay.  AERC will pay you $100 for the two reviews as a token of our appreciation.
